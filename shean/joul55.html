                GE Elective 1 was a journey.  The coding part was surprisingly fun. I thought I'd be completely lost, but it was like putting together a puzzle, one line of code at a time.  There were definitely moments of "what in the world is happening?!" and frantic Googling, but the feeling of accomplishment when I finally got my webpage to work was amazing.  My friends and I helped each other out. Itâ€™s cool to think about how these skills could be useful in nursing someday or in anything; We tackled some heavy topics, and it made me realize how much I still need to learn. It was interesting to explore different viewpoints. It wasn't always easy, but it was definitely thought-provoking.
