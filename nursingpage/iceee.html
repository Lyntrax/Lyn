                First semester of nursing school flew by!  I learned so much, and I'm really proud of myself.  My GE coding class was a surprise – I actually learned some useful stuff, like how to make my own personal page.  Anatomy and Physiology was amazing; I finally understand how the human body works! Biochemistry taught me about different vitamins, energy, and many more.

            Theoretical Fundamentals gave me a great history lesson on nursing, which I really appreciated.  Even math class was eye-opening – I never thought about shapes and colors being part of it! (Ps: I enjoy computations especially the easy one). Humanities was fun; all the debates and activities really helped me think critically and logically. Understanding the Self helped me get more comfortable being myself.

                And Pathfit?  I learned so much about healthy eating and living, I enjoy our dancing practices too (haha I miss it). And  I'm super excited to move on to Level 2!  I'll miss my professors too, especially the nice ones:").

                The thing that I want to learn more is (I really don't know, I'll just wait for it)I'm ready for the next challenge!(HAHAHA).
