                    My first semester as a nursing student flew by in a whirlwind of excitement and challenge!  I loved the hands-on labs, especially the ones where we viewed different things under the microscope â€“ I felt like I was already making a real difference.

                    Anatomy and Physiology was fascinating, learning about the human body in such detail was amazing.  I also really enjoyed Medical Terminology; deciphering those complex words was like solving a puzzle.

                    While it was tough juggling all the major courses and additional activities from the minor courses, the rewarding feeling of learning such a different skills made it all worthwhile. I can't wait to see what the next semester brings!
