      <p>My first year in nursing school was a busy one!  I learned so much about the human body and all the different medical terms.  It was tough at first, trying to remember everything, but I kept studying and practicing.  I'm feeling more confident now.</p>
      
      <p>The medical terms were definitely the hardest part.  It felt like learning a whole new language!  But I found some study methods that worked for me, and I'm proud of how much I've improved.  I also learned how important it is to be really careful and accurate when I write things down. Overall, it's been a great learning experience.  I'm glad I stuck with it.</p>
