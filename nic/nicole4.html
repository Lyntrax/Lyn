                • If my pre-med course didn't work, then i'll probably study again to be an educator. I've always wanted to be a teacher.
                 Growing up, my dad's side of the family was full of teachers, so I've seen how rewarding the job can be. I'm pretty good at talking in front of people and explaining things to others—I really enjoy sharing what I know.
                   But teaching isn't my only dream.  I've always wanted to open a café bookshop, too. It's something I've thought about for a long, long time. I imagine a place filled with lots and lots of books—all kinds of books!  And it would have really good coffee, tea, and other drinks. Plus, delicious pastries and maybe some yummy sandwiches, too.  I think it would be a really nice place for people to relax, read, and chat with friends.  It would be a comfy and inviting space where people could enjoy a good book and a tasty treat.  The idea of combining my love of books and my love of food with my interest in teaching is very exciting! It feels like a perfect way to bring all my passions together. I hope someday I can make both of these dreams come true.
